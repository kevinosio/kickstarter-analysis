# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This Project is to help Louise's research, to better inform her about starting a Kickstarter. This Project contains two charts that help visualize different outcomes to varying Kickstarter. This will help Louise start their own successful Kickstarter.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
One conclusion you can make about the analysis is the best time to start a new Kickstarter campaign is during the second quarter of the year. Another conclusion that can be made is that the fourth quarter of the year has the lowest success numbers making it the worst time of the year to start a new campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
A conclusion that you can make about the "Outcomes based on Goals" chart is that there is a correlation with goal price and the outcome of the project. In this case the correlation is the higher the goal the less likely the project is to succeed.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges that I faced during making these charts were for one, I first had trouble with the "SumIfs" function. At first, I had trouble setting the multiple criteria but after revisiting the module I worked it out. Another issue I was facing was getting the correct formatting on the Charts, getting them to display the information I wanted and to look the way I wanted. That issue was solved by reading all the options available in excel and just playing with the different settings. 
## Results

There is a lot of data to work with and it definitely has additional tables and graphs that can be added to give more information. For example, in addition to the current charts a chart that shows the average time a project takes to succeed or how long projects take to close and be called as failed. This data can provide a period for how longs Louise plans to have their project open for. As for all the data there is to work with, it definitely has some limitations. For example, there was large gap in some of the goal data that could cause some scud data.
